                      <p>Learning to develope in a class enviornment as opposed to online and by myself has been fufilling.
                      Instead of learning various tags and methods of developing with no real direction, in a class evviornment I learn from
                      people more experienced in the field. I learn specific information that will be useful to  companies
                      and make me more valueable as an employee. It's helpful that I've took some time out to complete
                      classes by myself because I haven't really struggled with any of my assignments. I feel I have become
                      a better developer in the past few weeks from taking courses as opposed to learning on my own.</p>

            <p>Learning to develope in a class enviornment as opposed to online and by myself has been fufilling.
            Instead of learning various tags and methods of developing with no real direction, in a class evviornment I learn from
            people more experienced in the field. I learn specific information that will be useful to  companies
            and make me more valueable as an employee. It's helpful that I've took some time out to complete
            classes by myself because I haven't really struggled with any of my assignments. I feel I have become
            a better developer in the past few weeks from taking courses as opposed to learning on my own.</p>
